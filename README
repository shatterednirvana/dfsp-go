This program is an implementation of the DFSP SSA
(http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~cse/Files/DFSP.pdf) in the Go programming language.
Compile it with 'make'.

To run: ./6.out
To run and collect profiling info: ./6.out -cpuprofile=dfsp.prof

Right now the code is in 'testing' mode, where it only runs one reaction. This
makes it a lot easier to collect profiling info. To make it run all reactions
it needs to run, open 'dfspsolver.go' and change these lines:

        //for t < tFinal {
        for t < 1 {

to:

        for t < tFinal {
        //for t < 1 {
